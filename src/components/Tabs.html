      <p>Cardura is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and other
        conditions. It belongs to a class of drugs called alpha-adrenergic blockers, which work by relaxing the
        muscles in the bladder and prostate. This helps to reduce symptoms of BPH such as difficulty urinating,
        weak stream, and the need to urinate frequently or urgently. Cardura helps to lower high blood pressure
        by relaxing the blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily. It can also be used to treat
        Raynaudâ€™s phenomenon, a condition in which certain areas of the body, usually the fingers and toes,
        become cold and numb due to a decrease in blood flow. Cardura is available as a tablet and should be
        taken with meals.
        Common side effects include dizziness, headache, tiredness, and diarrhea. Make sure to talk to your
        doctor or pharmacist before taking Cardura.</p>
